# Bynder Star Wars

Available here : 



Is an app you can see some characters from Star Wars.

You can sort the characters and filter them with the search bar.

You can perform a click on a character to get to his detail page.

In the detail page you can see the resident from the planet the character is and
click it to navigate to the detail page from this resident.

Enjoy !

# The project

To run the project in developement you have to run

```bash
npm install
```
The first time

and then 

```bash
npm run dev
```

# The tests


To run the test you have to run

```bash
npm run test
```

Here I use Vitest to simulate the DOM because it works more easily with Vite than Jest.

To run the test coverages

```bash
npm run coverage
```

You will see a folder coverage appearing in the root bynder-star-wars folder.
